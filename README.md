==========

Ray tracing assignment for CS410 fall 2014.



I feel so close and yet so far from finishing.

I don't know why but I'm not printing reasonable depth values to my .ppm files.

Color values are now working, but I'm only drawing one sphere and covering the rest.

My program runs fast which is nice but just does not seem to get the right values.
