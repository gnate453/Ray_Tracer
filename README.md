==========
NOTE:
Programs runs slow!

As of 12/12/2014

Shadows attempted but turned off.  They were blocking all light except ambient.

Refreaction not implemmented.

Still having issues with camera placement.  (most test cases will fail for this reason).

Since I could not fix my problem with camera placement I've included a test file m2.obj m2.mtl and c2, which are nearly the same as scene1 test file provided except spheres have been moved down the -z axis and the camera has been adjusted to capute the spheres.  This is simply to prove reflection is implemented.  







As of 11/16/14 late submission two

polygons incorrect but attempted.

still isses with camera some camera placements.

As of 11/15/14 late submission for a4

cross product issue I think



As of 11/8/14 this program appears to meet the a3 specifications.

fixed: 
	-ambient lighting.
	-distacne to object origins and intersections measured from world coordinate of pixels instead of prp.
	-clipping planes
